## What is OOP
- Based on the concepts of objects
- Can contain data in the form of attributes or properties
- Can contain actions in the form of functions or methods
## What are the 4 pillars
- Encapsulation.
- Inheritance.
- Abstraction.
- Polymorphism

## What are the benefits of OOP
- Polymorphism makes the code flexible
- no reusing code
- Encapsulation allows for easier troubleshooting

## Functionality of each pilar
- Abstraction - Abstraction is getting rid of unnecessary information for the user. We should only care about calling the method and the not underlying implementation.
- Encapsulation - Is a fundamental concept in OOP. It is the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit. This is usually used to hide internal representaion, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding
- Inheritance - inherits methods from another class
- Polymorphism - allows nuktiple data types
